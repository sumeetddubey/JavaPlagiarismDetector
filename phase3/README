Instruction for Release Version

Introduction:

The target language of our plagiarism detection application is Java. Our application has three layers: HashcodeComparison, 
FunctionSignatureComparison, and ASTComparison. In this release version, all three layers have been fully implemented. 
You can test it with your own Java files. The detailed instructions are stated below. As far as the UI is concerned,
we are still working on merging it with the back-end. Although we have released a really simple UI, it isn't stable.

Steps to Test:

Since we our user interface is not stable, we cannot provide you an executable jar file. You have to install an IDE, 
such as eclipse or intellij, on your machine. In addition, you have to install Java JDK 1.8 on your machine. 
Our project utilizes maven. If you have no idea with IDE, JDK or Maven, you can check following links.

Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/
JDK 1.8: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Maven: https://maven.apache.org/

Once you complete above prerequiests, you can use git command to clone our project from github repository to your local machine.
Then, open your IDE and open our maven project. All dependencies can be automated downloaded. You do not have to worry about it.
You can run the DriverTest.java in src/main/java/driver, and replace test files with your own. One thing to be mentioned is
that you have to save your own test files under src/main/java/resource, otherwise the application cannot successfully run.

Features:
  - Three layers of plagiarism detection
  - Simple user interface
  - The validation of upload files will be implemented in next release version.
  
Tests:
  To find all tests we write for our application, you can go to src/test/java. The following tests you can find from different packages:
  - GreedyStringTilingTests.java
  - ASTComparatorTests.java
  - FunctionSignatureTests.java
